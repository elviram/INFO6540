She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is here here here
She's convinced she could hold back a glacier
But she could'nt keep baby alive
Doubting if there's a woman in there somewhere here here here
You say you don't want it again and again but you don't don't really mean it
You say you don't want it this circus were in but you don't, don't really mean it, you don't don't Really mean it
If the divine master plan is perfected
Maybe next I'll give Judus a try
Trusting my soul to the icecream assassin here here here
You say you don't want it again and again but you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it this circus were in but you don't, don't really mean it, you don't don't Really mean it
How mant fates turn around in the overturn
Ballerina's that have fins that you'll never find
You thought that you were the bomb yes well so did I
Say you don't want it say you don't want it
How mant fates turn around in the overturn
Ballerina's that have fins that you'll never find
You thought that you were the bomb yes well so did I
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it, say you don't want it again and again but you don't, Don't really mean it
You say you don't want it
This circus were in but you don't, don't really mean it
Don't really mean it
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is here here here
